		On Thursday, October 24, 2013, the Federation of Associations and Corporations Teen 06 organized for the fifth time, Student Welcome Day ( JAE ), 
		in partnership with the City of Nice, Nice CROUS -Toulon, PACA Region and the University of Nice - Sophia Antipolis.
		For the whole day, all new entrants to the university whether in BTS or in private school, students stood for the colours of their 
		campus on the day completely unmarked.<br><br>
		The day was divided into three parts:<br><br>

		<strong><em>The morning - The Rally</em></strong><br>
		It is from 9:00am, at the Campus St. Jean d'Angely, that the students gathered to prepare and train their teams. Blue, red, yellow and green, the campus wearing their colors to <em>face</em> throughout the day.
		Breakfast was also served, and was hosted by the CROUS Nice- Toulon.
		After animations and speech, the starting signal for the race, "clapping", was given at 10am. Students then left on an adventure in 
		Nice, following a rhythmic puzzle to finally get to the castle.<br><br>

		<strong><em>The afternoon - Inter-Campus Challenge</em></strong><br>
		Students assembled at 14h at the Palais des Expositions to represent their campus. Campus against campus, everyone fought in 
		inflatable structures for their teams. On site, a village composed of different partners of the day was there. At the end of the afternoon only a campus emerged victorious.<br><br>

		<strong><em>The night - Responsible Evening</em></strong><br>
		At night, the Exhibition transformed into the biggest nightclub in Nice. 
		All students of the University and Grandes Ecoles were invited, 5,000 students were expected for the biggest night of the year. 
		Alcohol consumption was limited to three per person.<br>
