	During the first semester at the University of Kuala Lumpur, the students follow the general engineering course. But from the second semester of the Pre-France 
	Programme, they must choose their specialty that will decide the IUT in which they will enroll.
	To be eligible for the Pre-France Programme, it is necessary to obtain good results in SPM.<br><br>
	&diams;&nbsp;&nbsp;RT department (Networking and Telecommunications) trains future graduates in all areas of the latest communication technologies. It is part of <br> 
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SophiaTech campus, at the heart of Sophia Antipolis, the largest technology park in Europe.<br><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main subjects taught in R&amp;T are :<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Networking and Internet<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Language and communication <br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Fixed and Mobile Telecommunications <br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Computing<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Mathematics <br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Electronic and Physics <br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Knowledge of business<br><br>
	&diams;&nbsp;&nbsp;The GEII Department (Electrical Engineering and Industrial Computing), trains its future graduates in areas within electricity, electronics industrial computing, <br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and their applications. The skills acquired throughout this course are applied in areas as diverse as manufacturing and processing industries,<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;management of energy, transport and automobile, health, food and many others. <br><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main subjects taught in GEII are :<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Mathematics, Physics and culture <br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Expression and communication <br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- English <br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Electrical energy <br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Electrical and Power Electronics <br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Industrial IT, digital electronics, logic synthesis<br><br>
	It is then found that the difference between the two sectors is the specialty of each. The subjects studied are almost the same which results in 
	further studies, students can opt for the same professional license or even master, so it will only depend on the subject to which the student looks
	or by which he is passionate.<br><br>
