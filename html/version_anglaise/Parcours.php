	<br><br>
	The 4-month integration program is called "Bridging Program". From mid-April 
	to late August, the students are divided into 4 groups in different IUT

	-August: lessons at Alliance Fran&ccedil;aise (13:00 to 17:00).<br><br>
	
	During the first two months at Alliance Fran&ccedil;aise, the students are mixed with other foreign students, and seperated into groups 
	according to their level of French language (B1/B2). While during the last 
	two months, the Malaysian students are rejoined into two groups to prepare  
	for the TCF (Test Knowledge of French) which takes place in late August.<br><br>
