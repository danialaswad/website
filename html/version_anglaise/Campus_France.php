	<strong>1. Learning the french language</strong><br> 
		To study in France, the "intermediate advanced" level (B1, B2) is 
		usually sufficient and to register in the first or second year at french 
		universities, foreign candidates (non-European) must follow the procedure of 
		"Requesting Admission Prerequisites "(DAP). In this context, 
		they must prove their French language proficiency level by taking a test. 
		As far as the Malaysian students are concerned, the french language is taught at University of Kuala Lumpur 
		in Malaysia and at a language school in Nice, France.<br><br>
		Warning: ignorance of the French language is the primary cause of failure of foreign students.<br><br>
	<strong>2. Enrolling at the IUT</strong><br>
	Campus France manage everything related to the admission to the IUT. There are only a few forms to be completed.
	<br><br>
	<strong>3. Obtaining the visa</strong><br>
	It is very important, upon arrival in France, to send to OFII by registered mail (with confirmation of receipt):
	- the stamped OFII certification form that they received from the official who granted their visa<br>
	- a copy of the pages of their passport bearing their identity data and the stamp signifying entry into France or another country of the Schengen Area.
	<br><br>
	Upon receipt of these documents, the OFII will send, by regular mail to the address provided by the visa holder, a letter acknowledging receipt of the form and summoning the applicant for a 
	medical visit (if such a visit was not carried out in the applicant’s home country) or an orientation session. <br><br>
	<strong>4. Taking care of yourself</strong><br>
	French health-care coverage, provided under the social security system ("Sécurité sociale"), is of very high quality. Covered individuals are reimbursed for a portion of their medical expenses 
	in return for a low basic payment. For students, that payment reaches €211 in 2013/2014 (1). You join the plan at your higher education institution when you register for classes at the beginning 
	of the academic year. Participation in the plan is mandatory for non-European students. 
<br><br>
Students from countries in the European Economic Space are exempted from participation as long as they hold either a European health insurance card (or temporary certificate) valid for the entire 
academic year or a certificate of private insurance providing full coverage for medical risks without restrictions related to cost. 
<br><br>
The two main student group health plans are:
<br><br>
&diams;  &nbsp; &nbsp;LMDE (La Mutuelle des Étudiants)<br>
&diams;  &nbsp; &nbsp;emVia, which groups 11 regional student "mutuelles"
<br><br>
To benefit from the national student health-care system, students must be under 28 years of age and registered in a program for at least 4 months in an approved institution of higher education.
